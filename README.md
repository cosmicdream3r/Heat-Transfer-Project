# Heat Transfer Project
**Project 07** <br />
Analyze 2D steady heat conduction in a rectangular domain with internal heat generation and radiation boundary conditions. Students will need to map the geometry, set up the finite element model, incorporate the nonlinear radiation boundary conditions, and solve for the temperature field.<br />

Assumptions: <br/>
1. Heat transfer is steady and two-dimensional. <br />
2. Thermal conductivity is constant. <br />
3. Heat generation is uniform. <br />

The radiation boundary condition is employed in extreme temperature applications and in vacuum environments like space. A real life application of this problem would be in satellite thermal control, to keep electronics within adequate working temperatures.<br />

**Pyhon Libraries Used**<br />

Tkinter - Used for the GUI.
User friendly way of getting inputs and displaying data.<br />
NumPy - Used for array math.<br />
SciPy.spatial - Used for spatial algorithms.
Stores data objects organized by position for node connection in plots.<br />
Matplotlib - Used for display.
Allows for data to be visualized in an easy to understand temperature gradient.<br />
