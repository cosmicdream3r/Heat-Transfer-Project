# Heat-Transfer-Project
Project 07
Analyze 2D steady heat conduction in a rectangular domain with internal heat generation and radiation boundary conditions. Students will need to map the geometry, set up the finite element model, incorporate the nonlinear radiation boundary conditions, and solve for the temperature field.

Assumptions:
Heat transfer is steady and two-dimensional. 
Thermal conductivity is constant
Heat generation is uniform.
